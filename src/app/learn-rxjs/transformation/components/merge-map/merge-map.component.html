    <p class="text-read">
        Projects each source value to an observable which is merged in the output observable.

        MergeAll + Map
    </p>
    <p class="text-read">
        Usage: This operator is mostly used when you need to map a plain value to an observable. A common use case is
        mapping URL strings into HTTP requests.

        mergeMap operator is basically a combination of two operators - merge and map. The map part lets you map a value from a source observable to an observable stream. Those streams are often referred to as inner streams. The merge part than works like mergeAll - it combines all inner observable streams returned from the map and concurrently emits all values from every input stream.

        As values from any combined sequence are produced, those values are emitted as part of the resulting sequence. Such process is often referred to as flattening in documentation.
        
        Use this operator if youâ€™re not concerned with the order of emissions and is simply interested in all values coming out from multiple combined streams as if they were produced by one stream.
