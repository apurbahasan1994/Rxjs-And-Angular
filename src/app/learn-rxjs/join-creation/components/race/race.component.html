        Used to select an observable sequence that is the first to produce values as soon as one of the sequences
        starts emiting values the other sequences are unsubscribed
        and completely ignored.
    </p>

    <p>
        Use Case: This operator can be useful if you have multiple resources that can provide values, for example,
        servers around the world, but due to network conditions the latency is not predictable and varies significantly.
        Using this operator you can send the same request out to multiple data sources and consume the result of the
        first that responds.

        Hereâ€™s an example of using race to run multiple HTTP requests and cancel one of them:
    </p>
    <p>Api res that came first</p>
    <p>{{source$|async}}</p>
